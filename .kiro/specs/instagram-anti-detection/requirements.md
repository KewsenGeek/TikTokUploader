# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines requirements for implementing advanced anti-detection mechanisms for Instagram automation using Playwright. The system must simulate maximum human-like behavior to avoid detection by Instagram's sophisticated bot detection algorithms. The goal is to create an undetectable automation system that behaves indistinguishably from real human users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Human-Like Playwright Interactions

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to interact with Instagram through Playwright in a completely human-like manner, so that my behavior patterns are indistinguishable from real users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking elements THEN the system SHALL use realistic mouse movements and positioning variations
2. WHEN typing text THEN the system SHALL include natural errors, corrections, and variable speeds
3. WHEN navigating pages THEN the system SHALL simulate reading delays and natural scanning patterns
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent timing that doesn't disrupt upload logic
5. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL use human-like focus patterns and field assessment

### Requirement 2: Human-Like Interaction Patterns

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to simulate realistic human interaction patterns, so that my behavior is indistinguishable from real users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking elements THEN the system SHALL use curved mouse movements with realistic timing variations
2. WHEN typing text THEN the system SHALL include natural typing errors, corrections, and variable speeds
3. WHEN navigating pages THEN the system SHALL simulate reading delays, attention patterns, and natural scanning
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL include thinking pauses, hesitation, and decision-making delays
5. WHEN interacting with forms THEN the system SHALL simulate multiple focus attempts and field assessment behavior

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Behavioral Variability

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to exhibit dynamic behavioral variations, so that I don't follow predictable patterns that could be detected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing behavior THEN the system SHALL generate random timing variations for each session
2. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL use different delay ranges that vary unpredictably
3. WHEN typing THEN the system SHALL vary error rates and typing speeds dynamically within realistic ranges
4. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL use randomized pause frequencies without fixed patterns
5. WHEN fatigued THEN the system SHALL gradually increase delays and error rates based on session duration

### Requirement 4: Natural Workflow Simulation

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to simulate natural human workflow patterns, so that my activity appears organic and realistic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting sessions THEN the system SHALL simulate page loading assessment and content scanning
2. WHEN between actions THEN the system SHALL include workflow delays with occasional distractions
3. WHEN uploading content THEN the system SHALL simulate content review, caption composition, and posting hesitation
4. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL simulate human confusion, retry attempts, and problem-solving behavior
5. WHEN completing tasks THEN the system SHALL include post-action verification and natural exit patterns

### Requirement 5: Advanced Timing and Rhythm

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to use sophisticated timing algorithms, so that my action patterns don't reveal automation signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating delays THEN the system SHALL use time-of-day multipliers reflecting human activity patterns
2. WHEN performing repetitive actions THEN the system SHALL vary timing using non-uniform distributions
3. WHEN under fatigue THEN the system SHALL increase delays and decrease precision realistically
4. WHEN distracted THEN the system SHALL include longer pauses simulating phone checks or interruptions
5. WHEN focused THEN the system SHALL use shorter, more consistent delays reflecting concentration

### Requirement 6: Upload Logic Preservation

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to maintain human-like behavior without breaking existing upload functionality, so that uploads continue to work reliably while appearing natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding human behavior THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing upload success logic
2. WHEN timing varies THEN the system SHALL not cause timeouts or failures in critical upload steps
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain existing error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the system SHALL ensure all selectors and workflows remain functional
5. WHEN simulating behavior THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade if human simulation fails

### Requirement 7: Multi-Modal Deception Integration

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want to coordinate all deception mechanisms, so that browser fingerprinting, behavioral patterns, and timing work together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing THEN the system SHALL coordinate viewport, user-agent, and behavioral profile selection
2. WHEN active THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between declared capabilities and actual behavior
3. WHEN switching contexts THEN the system SHALL preserve behavioral continuity across different page interactions
4. WHEN under scrutiny THEN the system SHALL intensify human-like behaviors without appearing suspicious
5. WHEN completing sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain behavioral consistency through cleanup and exit

### Requirement 8: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As an automation system, I want anti-detection mechanisms to be reliable and performant, so that they don't interfere with core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN anti-detection is active THEN the system SHALL maintain upload success rates above 95%
2. WHEN simulating behavior THEN the system SHALL complete actions within reasonable time bounds
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to simpler behaviors without breaking
4. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL scale behavioral complexity based on available resources
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of behavioral decisions and timing patterns
