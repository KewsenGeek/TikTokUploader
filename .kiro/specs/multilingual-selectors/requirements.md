# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to ensure comprehensive support for Spanish and Portuguese selectors across all Playwright interactions in the Instagram automation system. Currently, the system has partial multilingual support with inconsistent coverage across different components. This enhancement will provide complete, systematic support for Spanish (es) and Portuguese (pt) locales, ensuring reliable automation regardless of the user's Instagram interface language.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Instagram automation to work reliably with Spanish-language Instagram interfaces, so that users from Spanish-speaking regions can use the system without language-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Instagram interface is displayed in Spanish THEN all upload workflow selectors SHALL correctly identify Spanish text elements
2. WHEN the login process encounters Spanish interface elements THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate using Spanish-specific selectors
3. WHEN error dialogs appear in Spanish THEN the system SHALL properly detect and handle Spanish error messages
4. WHEN success notifications are shown in Spanish THEN the system SHALL correctly identify Spanish success indicators
5. WHEN form elements have Spanish placeholders or labels THEN the system SHALL locate and interact with them successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Instagram automation to work reliably with Portuguese-language Instagram interfaces, so that users from Portuguese-speaking regions can use the system without language-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Instagram interface is displayed in Portuguese THEN all upload workflow selectors SHALL correctly identify Portuguese text elements
2. WHEN the login process encounters Portuguese interface elements THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate using Portuguese-specific selectors
3. WHEN error dialogs appear in Portuguese THEN the system SHALL properly detect and handle Portuguese error messages
4. WHEN success notifications are shown in Portuguese THEN the system SHALL correctly identify Portuguese success indicators
5. WHEN form elements have Portuguese placeholders or labels THEN the system SHALL locate and interact with them successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hardcoded text selectors to be centralized and internationalized, so that maintaining multilingual support is consistent and manageable across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all hardcoded text-based selectors SHALL be removed from individual files
2. WHEN adding new selectors THEN they SHALL be defined in the centralized selector configuration with multilingual variants
3. WHEN updating selector logic THEN changes SHALL automatically apply to all supported languages
4. WHEN a new language needs to be added THEN the process SHALL require only updates to the centralized configuration
5. WHEN debugging selector issues THEN developers SHALL have a single source of truth for all selector definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the automation to gracefully handle mixed-language scenarios, so that the system remains functional even when Instagram displays inconsistent language elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Instagram displays mixed language elements THEN the system SHALL attempt selectors in priority order (user locale → English → fallback)
2. WHEN a primary language selector fails THEN the system SHALL automatically try alternative language variants
3. WHEN no language-specific selector works THEN the system SHALL fall back to semantic selectors (aria-labels, roles, etc.)
4. WHEN selector fallback occurs THEN the system SHALL log the fallback for monitoring and improvement
5. WHEN multiple language variants are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on the account's configured locale

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive logging of selector usage and failures, so that I can identify and resolve multilingual selector issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a selector is used successfully THEN the system SHALL log which language variant was effective
2. WHEN a selector fails THEN the system SHALL log all attempted language variants and their failure reasons
3. WHEN fallback selectors are used THEN the system SHALL record the fallback chain for analysis
4. WHEN new Instagram interface changes are detected THEN the system SHALL log potential selector compatibility issues
5. WHEN selector performance varies by language THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the i18n system to be integrated with selector management, so that text-based selectors automatically use the correct translations for each supported locale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating text-based selectors THEN the system SHALL use the i18n manager to get localized text variants
2. WHEN an account has a specific locale configured THEN selectors SHALL prioritize that locale's text variants
3. WHEN the i18n system is updated with new translations THEN selectors SHALL automatically incorporate the new text variants
4. WHEN debugging selector issues THEN the system SHALL show which i18n keys were used for text-based selectors
5. WHEN adding new text-based selectors THEN developers SHALL use i18n keys instead of hardcoded text strings
