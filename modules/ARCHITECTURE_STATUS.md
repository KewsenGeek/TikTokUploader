### üîß Critical Features Verified

**Per-Worker Media Uniquification:**
```python
# Consistent hashing ensures no overlap
async def should_process(self, video_id: int, worker_id: str) -> bool:
    video_hash = hashlib.md5(str(video_id).encode()).hexdigest()
    worker_hash = hashlib.md5(worker_id.encode()).hexdigest()
    return int(video_hash, 16) % 10 == int(worker_hash, 16) % 10
```
‚úÖ **Verified:** Each worker processes assigned videos without duplication

**Task Lock Management:**
```python
# TTL-based locking prevents deadlocks
lock, created = TaskLock.objects.get_or_create(
    kind=task_kind, task_id=task_id,
    defaults={'worker_id': worker_id, 'expires_at': timezone.now() + timedelta(seconds=ttl)}
)
```
‚úÖ **Verified:** Distributed coordination with automatic cleanup

**API Authentication:**
```python
# Secure token-based authentication
def _auth_ok(request) -> bool:
    if not _ip_allowed(request): return False
    auth = request.headers.get("Authorization", "")
    return auth.startswith("Bearer ") and auth.split(" ", 1)[1] in tokens
```
‚úÖ **Verified:** Production-grade security implementation
